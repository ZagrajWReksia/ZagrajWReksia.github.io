            "cityOfSecrets2Description": `Usually, a perilous adventure hides behind a completely innocent beginning. A beginning that doesn't mention anything about a giant worm, dangerous cooking recipes, the common people fighting the oppressive regime, rebelling workers and trade unions. Nor does it mention a strange salesman that forgoes the career of a dark god to start his own fish stand business. An innocent beginning doesn't say anything that could be linked to words like danger, trouble, or threat. It's just the way with all those adventures, it seems they have nothing better to do than just render a man's... animal's... mole's... life unpleasant.
                    
                    Moles the Mole, a not-so-bright and nice hero, but a hero nonetheless, will have the questionable opportunity to discover what fate has in store for him. One night, closer to morning than evening, Moles has been brutally awakened by scary noises. Fear tightened it's icy grip on Moles's heart and just when our hero was about to execute a tactical withdrawal, the mystery solved itself - with a terrifying series of noises, our hero's most impressive muscle was demanding a night snack. Unfortunately, the problem with adventure games is that nothing's ever easy in them. The fridge is empty, the designer didn't draw a larder and the writer already had an idea how to complicate the hero's life. Now that's an innocent beginning, if I've ever seen one. And you know what's the usual deal with those innocent beginnings.
                    
                    This game was tested on animals. They didn't like it and went away.

Początek, który nie ma nic wspólnego z gigantycznymi robakami, podejrzanymi przepisami, walką ludu z reżimem, protestującymi robotnikami czy związkami zawodowymi. Ani z osobliwym sprzedawcą rezygnującym z kariery mrocznego bóstwa na rzecz prowadzenia własnego stoiska rybnego.

Pewnej nocy (bliżej rana niż wieczora) Kretes został brutalnie zbudzony przez przerażające odgłosy. Strach zacisnął swe szpony na sercu biednego kreta i gdy ten szykował się już do taktycznego odwrotu... zagadka rozwiązała się sama - za mrożącymi krew w żyłach odgłosami stał najbardziej imponujący mięsień bohatera, domagając się w ten sposób nocnej przekąski. Niestety, z grami przygodowymi jest taki problem, że nic nie jest w nich proste. Lodówka okazała się pusta, spiżarni projektant nie raczył narysować, scenarzysta za to zdążył już wpaść na pomysł, jak utrudnić życie Kretesowi. To dopiero niewinny początek.

Przeznaczony jest do nauki podstaw alfabetu, funkcji litery w słowie oraz czytania i rozumienia prostych słów, zwrotów i zdań. Program jest rozbudowany i zróżnicowany. Zawiera około 300 gier i zabaw. Znaleźć tu można zarówno kurs nauki alfabetu, jak i wiele zabaw związanych z poznawaniem liter.
                    "ABC z Reksiem" składa się z trzech części: gry, elementarza i szkoły. Pierwsza z nich to wesoła zabawa, w której gracz pomaga Reksiowi skompletować alfabet, podczas rozwiązywania różnych gier i zgadywanek. Interaktywny elementarz to zbiór kolorowych stron poświęconych poszczególnym literkom. Znajdują się tu ukryte animacje, słowa i różne zabawy. Szkoła to przyjazny dziecku kurs nauki alfabetu składający się z około 100 zdań, zabaw i prezentacji. Dziecko uczy się tutaj nie tylko rozpoznawać litery, ale także posługiwać się nimi w różnych sytuacjach. Literkowa gra to zabawa ze Smokiem Literkowym, który porwał chłopca - najlepszego przyjaciela Reksia. Aby go uwolnić Reksio musi skompletować cały alfabet. Dziecko pomaga pieskowi. Jednocześnie poznaje alfabet, ćwiczy pisanie i czytanie. 
                    Centrum reksiowego świata stanowi podwórze domu. Tam ukryte jest 6 ciekawych gier, w których można zdobyć literki. W zabawie "Kura w opałach" Reksio musi odeprzeć ataki lisów. 
                    W "Szklarni" sadzi nasionko i hoduje literki, natomiast w "Maszynie koguta" zamienia przedmioty na litery. W grze: "Wędrowcy" uzupełnia brakujące litery w słowach, zaś w "Literkowym sklepie" sprzedaje przedmioty i zamienia je na literki. Reksio chodzi także "Na ryby" gdzie łowi przedmioty, które następnie może w sklepie zamienić na litery.

                    Poți deveni campion al memoriei jucând „Descoperă perechile” sau „Jucării ce dispar”, îți poți demonstra talentul de constructor în atelier unde va trebui să construiești conform schemei, vei fi mecanic de locomotivă și va trebui sa conduci toți pasagerii în Gara Centrală.
                    
                    Alte surprize te așteaptă, descoperă-le!

            "countingWithReksioDescription": `Puștiul tău îți spune că orele de matematică sunt plictisitoare, că adunările și scăderile îi dau bătăi de cap, iar înmulțirile și împărțirile sunt greu de rezolvat?
                    
                    Dacă te confrunți cu această problemă, sau doar dacă vrei să-i oferi un motiv de a-și petrece timpul intr-un mod interesant și plăcut, în care să se distreze, dar și să devină captivat de matematică, atunci Reksio și Matematica, te poate ajuta!
                    
                    Reksio va fi meditatorul personal! Alături de el, vei învăța să numeri, iar operațiile matematice de bază (adunarea, scăderea, înmulțirea, împărțirea) și figurile geometirce le vei aprofunda. De asemenea, vei rezolva probleme cu mulțimi, de logică matematică si ecuații!
                    
                    Nicicând nu a fost mai ușor sa înveți matematică! Alături de colegi haioși, vei reuși să-ți focalizezi atenția asupra problemelor ridicate de joc sau să te orientezi în spațiu, ghidându-te după o hartă! Acumularea cunoștințelor într-o manieră distractivă este doar începutul!
                    
                    Poți opta pentru două grade diferite de dificultate: greu și ușor, în funcție de vârstă, care te vor ajuta să-ți exersezi gândirea logică, capacitatea de asociere și de memorare. Poate fi folosit ca o metodă de testare a cunoștințelor dobândite.
                    
                    Deci, ajutați copilul să se distreze cu folos!
